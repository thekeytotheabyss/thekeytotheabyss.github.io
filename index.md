## Importing the Key
Before using the secret key, you must import it into your keyring. This step ensures that your system recognizes the key, allowing you to securely decrypt messages and sign documents. Note that this key is now a public secret key and should only be used to decrypt documents that were specifically encrypted for it. Follow the commands below (if using GPG) to properly import the key you previously obtained and saved.

```
$ ~ >gpg --import thekeytotheabyss.gpg
gpg: key EIEIOEIEIOEIEIO public key "The Key to the Abyss (The Key to the Abyss) <thekeytotheabyss@planetearth.internal>" imported
gpg: key EIEIOEIEIOEIEIO:secret key imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
gpg:       secret keys read: 1
gpg:   secret keys imported: 1
$ ~ >
```
